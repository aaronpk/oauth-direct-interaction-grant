                   OAuth 2.0 Direct Interaction Grant
          draft-parecki-oauth-direct-interaction-grant-latest

Abstract

   This document extends the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749]
   with a new grant type, the "Direct Interaction Grant", which can be
   used by applications that want to control the user experience of the
   process of obtaining authorization from the user.

   In many cases, this can provide an entirely browserless experience
   suited for native applications, only delegating to the browser in
   unexpected or error conditions.

   While a fully-delegated approach using the Authorization Code Grant
   is generally preferred, this draft provides a mechanism for the
   client to directly interact with the user.  This requires a high
   degree of trust between the authorization server and the client, as
   well as should only be considered when there are usability concerns
   with a browser-based approach, such as for native mobile or desktop
   applications.

1.  Introduction

   TODO

1.1.  Usage and Applicability

   TODO: Mention the trust prerequisites for this to be useful.
   Absolutely not allowed for third-party apps.  Designed for native
   apps, specifically first-party, when the AS and app are operated by
   the same entity, and the user understands them both as the same
   entity...

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization
   Code", "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Server" (AS),
   "Client", "Client Authentication", "Client Identifier", "Client
   Secret", "Grant Type", "Protected Resource", "Redirection URI",
   "Refresh Token", "Resource Owner", "Resource Server" (RS) and "Token
   Endpoint" defined by [RFC6749].

3.  Protocol Overview

   1.  The client prompts the user and collects their user identifier
       (e.g. email address)

   2.  The client sends the identifier to the AS

   3.  The AS replies with the supported authentication mechanisms based
       on the user ID provided

   4.  The client requests an authentication challenge from the AS

   5.  The AS delivers a challenge to the user (e.g. one-time code via
       email, SMS, or a push notification in an app)

   6.  The client collects the necessary authentication details from the
       user and sends them back to the AS

   7.  The AS decides if additional requirements need to be met,
       repeating steps 3 through 6 as needed

   8.  The AS replies with the token response

4.  Protocol

4.1.  Client collects user identifier

   TODO: User identifier can be an email, phone number, or username, at
   the discretion of the AS.

4.2.  Client initiates direct interaction request

   The client makes a request to the interaction request endpoint
   providing the client ID and user identifer hint in the request.

   POST /interaction
   Host: authorization-server.com
   Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   &client_id=XXXXXXX
   &username=user@example.com
   &scope=contacts+openid+profile

4.3.  Authorization Server returns challenge types

   The AS returns an interaction code, as well as a list of challenge
   types supported.

   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   Content-type: application/json

   {
     "error": "...?",
     "interaction_code": "b135ac938e3e84",
     "challenge_type": [
       "password+totp", "email_otp", "redirect"
     ]
   }

4.3.1.  One-Time code

   *  email_otp

   *  sms_otp

   One-time codes sent via email or SMS

4.3.2.  TOTP

   *  totp

   TOTP codes generated by an authenticator app

4.3.3.  Password

   *  password

   Legacy password authentication

4.3.4.  Push notification

   *  push_notification

   A push notification delivered to a native application

4.3.5.  Redirect

   *  redirect

   In the case where the authorization server wishes to interact with
   the user itself, limiting the client's interaction with the user, it
   can return the redirect challenge type.  In this case, no
   interaction_code is returned.  Instead, the client is expected to
   initiate a traditional OAuth Authorization Code flow with PKCE
   according to [RFC6749] and [RFC7636].

   TODO: Instead of no interaction code, should this require the client
   include the interaction code in the authorization request so the AS
   can link it to an app-initiated session?  Alternatively, if we make
   the first request require a PKCE code challenge, we could require the
   same PKCE code challenge be used in the authorization request.

   This can be used to:

   *  offer the client a fallback mechanism at the client's perogative
      (by returning the redirect type as the last item in the
      challenge_type list)

   *  force the client to use a browser-redirect-based flow (by
      returning only the redirect type)

   *  enable authentication with social providers or third party IdPs
      which require a browser flow

4.3.6.  Combinations

   The AS MAY combine challenge types by concatenating strings with a +,
   which indicates that all the combined types are required to complete
   the challenge.

4.3.7.  Defining additional methods

   Extensibility...

4.4.  Client requests an authentication challenge

   Optional.

   For methods that require the AS to deliver a code to the user, e.g.
   via email or SMS, the client needs to signal to the AS that it should
   deliver this code.  (Without this step, the AS may not know which of
   the available options the client will be communicating to the user,
   and may not want to send a code via both email and SMS.)

   POST /challenge
   Host: authorization-server.com
   Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   challenge_type=email_otp
   &interaction_code=b135ac938e3e84

   The authorization server sends a challenge code to the user via the
   selected platform.

   The authorization server responds with an authentication challenge
   code and other information such as timeouts.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-type: application/json

   {
     "challenge_type": "email_otp",
     "challenge_code": "a6f4463ad1d8e3f",
     "expires_in": 600,
     "interval": 5
   }

   *  challenge_type -

   *  challenge_code -

   *  expires_in - Optional

   *  interval - Optional

4.5.  Client provides authentication details

   The client prompts the user to enter the challenge.

   *  One-time code

   *  Password

   *  Out-of-band interaction

   Some methods such as acknowledging a push notification may not
   require the user to interact further with the client.  The client
   instead presents a screen to the user explaining that they should
   acknowledge the challenge on another device.

4.5.1.  Token request

   The client makes a request to the token endpoint with the grant_type
   value of urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:direct, providing the
   information collected from the user as well as the previous
   interaction code and optional challenge code.

   POST /token

   Host: authorization-server.com
   Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:direct
   &client_id=XXXXXXX
   &interaction_code=b135ac938e3e84
   &challenge_code=a6f4463ad1d8e3f
   &challenge_value=512512

   *  challenge_value - The value that was sent to the user.  Should
      this be different depending on the challenge type?

   TODO: What happens if more than one code is requested?  Maybe make it
   so only one can be collected at a time?  It would be weird to ask the
   user to enter two codes at the same time anyway

4.6.  Checking for additional requirements

   If the initial set of information provided by the client is correct,
   the AS MAY choose to either respond immetiately with a successful
   token request, or prompt the client with an additional challenge.

   For example, the AS could first require the client prompt the user
   for a one-time-code they received via email, and then in a second
   step, ask the client to prompt the user

5.  Refresh Token Grant

   TODO: Describe how the AS could return a challenge to the client on
   the normal refresh token request that tells the client they need to
   get the user to re-authenticate or provide an MFA token.

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.1.  Phishing

   TODO: Describe the phishing risk this opens up.

6.2.  Client Authentication

   TODO: Describe the lack of client authentication possible because
   this is expected to be deployed by native apps.  Maybe mention
   alternatives to client authentication such as App Attestation, or
   using a risk engine to analyze other aspects of the request from the
   client.

6.3.  Leaking Information

   TODO: Attackers may be able to query the AS with user IDs to learn
   whether an identifier corresponds to an active account and which
   types of authentication a particular account has configured.  What
   mitigations needed here?  Possibly avoiding returning an error for
   unrecognized identifiers.

6.4.  Notification fatigue

   TODO: A client may be able to cause repeated notifications to any
   user given their user ID.  Mitigations?

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  OAuth Parameter Registration

   TODO

7.2.  OAuth URI Registration

   This specification registers the following values in the IANA "OAuth
   URI" registry [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] established by [RFC6755].

   URN: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:direct`
   Common Name: Direct Interaction Grant Type for OAuth 2.0
   Change Controller: IESG
   Specification Document:

7.3.  OAuth Extensions Error Registration

   This specification registers the following values in the IANA "OAuth
   Extensions Error Registry" registry [IANA.OAuth.Parameters]
   established by [RFC6749].

   Name: ...

7.4.  Authorization Server Metadata

   This specification defines two new endpoints at the authorization
   server.  TODO: Need to register these in the Authorization Server
   Metadata document too.

   *  interaction endpoint

   *  challenge endpoint
